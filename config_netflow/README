This folder contains the script to configure NetFlow on Cisco devices, and apply the flow monitors to trunk and routed interfaces.

The main file you will run from PowerShell or CLI is the "netflow.py" file, which will import and run the other Python files depending on
the OS type the Cisco device is running. 

User will be responsible for providing configuration files the scripts will use to push to the devices. User will also need to change the
capitalized text in the script to reflect the actual names of the flow records, monitors, exporters, samplers, and source-interfaces
to be used.

Optionally, at the end of the configuration scripts, there are lines of code that will enable the user to set different destination IP
addresses if a condition is met in the hostname. This is intended for environments that require different sites to send NetFlow data to
different collection servers based on what site they're at. 

For example, devices in Idaho might require NetFlow data be sent to a different
collection server than devices in Utah. The optional condition statement checks if a string is present in the hostname of the device and,
if it is present, will use a different destination IP address. Feel free to tweak according to your own needs.
